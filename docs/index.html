                  Up to six players are spread across the map "Workshop
                  Expanse". Each player is put in a bubble against an enemy
                  dummy bot.</p><p>The player kills the enemy bot and progresses to
                  the next hero in the list when the "Kill Goal" is met.</p><p>The
                  player can select any hero they would like to practice on. The
                  enemy spawn distances and play area will automatically be
                  adapted to the optimal sizes for the chosen hero.</p>

               The bots have AI scripting for every hero that I have

               The are currently 11 difficulties ranging from "No AI Easy" ('No
               AI' meaning they do not have AI or attack, but simply move.) to
               "AI Bronze" to "AI Top 500". The difficulties named for
               competitive tiers approximately reflect the aim, movement, and
               reaction time of real players at those tiers.

            <h2>Sandbox Approach To Practice</h2>
            <p>
               Raven's AI Dome is designed so that players can configure
               their own settings to best aid what they would like to practice.
            </p>
            <p>A few examples:</p>
            <h3>
               The player wishes to get better at
               <span class="hero-name">Roadhog</span>'s
               <span class="hero-name">Chain Hook</span> combo against supports.
            </h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Open the in-game menu,</li>
               <li>
                  set the "1 Second Cooldown" mode to "Player" so that the
                  player's cooldowns are automatically refreshed
               </li>
               <li>
                  While still in the menu, set the "Hero Class" to "Support"
               </li>
               <li>Close the menu and hook to your heart's content</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
               The player would just like to practice a
               <span class="hero-name">Widowmaker</span> 1v1 as long as they are
               in queue.
            </h3>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Select <span class="hero-name">Widowmaker</span> * Using the
                  key combination described in the top left to select a specific

               </li>
               <li>
                  Open the in-game menu, set the difficulty to the desired

         <h2>Development History</h2>
         <p>
            I started this project in January 2020 as soon as the "Workshop
            Expanse" map was released on the PTR.
         </p>
         <p>
            The idea came from my first practice mode on the Practice Range that
            spawned random types of enemies and gave them
            <i>very</i> rudimentary movement.
         </p>
         <p>
            I knew I wanted something that would spawn enemies at random
            distances from me facing a random direction. Initially I only
            intended it to be a small Widowmaker warmup and flick practice mode.
         </p>
         <p>
            It is currently in the pre-release stage with changes happening
            rapidly.
